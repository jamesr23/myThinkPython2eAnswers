# How many miles are there in 10 kilometers? Hint: there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile

print(10 / 1.61)

'''
    since a mile is 1.61 kilometers, 1 mile / 1.61 kilometers is 1

    multiplying 10 kilometers by 1 over 1.61, or dividing it by 1.61 will return the value of 10 kilometers in the proper unit

    10 kilometers * ( 1 mile / 1.61 kilometers ), which is the same as
    10 kilometers * 1
