# You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like -2. What happens if you put a plus sign before a number? What about 2++2?

2

-2

+2

++2

+-2

-+2

2++2

------2

'''
    the using a negative sign before the number will flip its value,
    identical to -1 * n

    placing a sign, (+ or -) after a number will result in a syntax error,
        such as 2+, 2-, 2++

    however, a term (2 ++- 2) is valid, because the signs affect the value on the second number
