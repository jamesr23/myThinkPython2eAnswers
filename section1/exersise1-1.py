# what happens if you leave out one of the parenthesis, or both?

print "hello world"

'''
this was valid syntax in python2, and is valid (syntax) in other scripting languages / shells
this will also produce a syntax error, to call a function, use parenthesis.
I think this could be because in python3 you can now pass in functions as arguments, so the interpreter would not know wether to run the function and pass in the return value or just pass in the function (pointer)

leaving out one parenthesis is a syntax error
