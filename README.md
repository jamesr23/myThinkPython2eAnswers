# myThinkPython2eAnswers

personal solutions and perspective of Allen B. Downey's thinkpython2e  
the book: https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e  
  
the files in the first few sections can be ran, and will return errors based on what the exersise is  
however it is in "interpreter format" because thats what is taught in the first session  
  
i also recomend reading the commments in each file because they explain the code
